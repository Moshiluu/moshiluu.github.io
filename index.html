                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>Greetings, fellow gamers and game enthusiasts! I'm Ethan Luu, a passionate Game Creator with a fervor for crafting
                    captivating virtual worlds. As a current Freshman in George Mason University's Computer Game Design Program, I have dedicated myself to the art and science of game design,
                    constantly seeking new challenges and creative outlets in this dynamic industry.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the realm of game design, I have roughly a year of Game Design experience so far,
                    where I've honed my skills and fueled my love for programming.
                    My journey began at a young age. As a child, I was always felt that video games acted as a brief escape from reality, where anything and everything can happen,
                    and since then, I've immersed myself in the intricacies of creating immersive and memorable gaming experiences, hoping that one day, I can inspire others to create games.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>What drives me in this ever-evolving field is the sheer magic of bringing ideas to life,
                    shaping interactive narratives, and providing players with a journey that transcends the
                    boundaries of reality. From the moment I stepped onto George Mason's Campus and took the Intro to Computer Game Design Course,
                    I fell in love and found my calling in game design, and I've been on an exhilarating quest ever since.
                </p>

                <h2>Charmweaver's Pursuit</h2>
                <p class="featured_para">
                    Charmweaver's Pursuit is a 2.5D deck-building game. It has voxel scenery with pixel art characters. Currently, the goal of the game is to stop the demon fox Sebatsian (far right). As Chase (left), you have the power to create magical charms to ward off and conjure spells against the shadows of Sebastian to gain strength. Eventually leading you to a final confrontation with Sebastian. This project started as a small idea, but now it has a team of four, with me as the programmer, with hopes of someday releasing it on Steam.

                    <p>The Boss Rush Game Jam is a month-long event going from January 5 to February 5. 
                        A game jam is an event where individuals or teams come together to create a video game within a
                        short period. Participants, often game developers, designers, programmers, and artists,
                        collaborate to conceptualize, design, and build a game from scratch based on a given theme
                        or set of constraints. I, allong with four teammates are competing in the Boss Rush Game Jam.
